# NeurodiverseMe

## Background story 

In this repository, we are sharing the session plan, session learnings and outcomes of the research we conducted to create the NeuroDiverseMe session, which was part of Mozfest's 2019 Neurodiversity space. By navigating the repo and the issue section, you'll come across useful resources if you intend to advocate and educate others about Neurodiversity inclusion in communities. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions. We are also attaching the session plan below for you to reuse and adapt according to your needs. 

## NeurodiverseMe session plan 

This is the remixable version of the session plan presented at Mozfest 2019. The plan was designed for a 60-minute session and can be easily be modified for groups of all sizes.

This session was directed to raise awareness about Neurodiversities and was designed to help people identify their special skills and interests. It can easily be adapted to other subjects and populations if required.

The plan was created by session co-facilitators Natalia Norori and Isabella Sevilla and is licensed CC-BY 4.0. For inquiries please contact Natalia or Isabella.

### Session Goal
Brainstorm ways to help neurodiverse individuals embrace what makes them different, and raise awareness on the positive qualities and perspectives they can bring to social development, communities, spaces, and events.

Empower communities to promote safe spaces that uplift the participation of neurodiverse voices, helping them maximize their potential to be active change-makers.

### Session Description for participants
Human neurodiversities should be celebrated, not treated as disorders. There are projects that have created code to make users experience what it feels like to be neurodivergent. However, most of these focus on the disadvantages without giving much emphasis to the positive qualities.

During this session we'll present previously collected experiences of what it feels like to be neurodivergent in the modern era, shifting the focus from the negative and enhancing the upsides that make it special. We'll also ask mozfesters at the session to share their own stories if they feel comfortable doing so.

Participants will also be invited to share experiences on how feeling welcomed and included in spaces has helped them make a positive impact in their communities, jobs or institutions.

After analyzing the stories shared, we'll divide into smaller groups to brainstorm ways to highlight the perks of being neurodivergent and brainstorm how might we create spaces that help maximize the potential of the neurodivergent, allowing them to play an important role in social development and community building.

participants will be encouraged to use their diverse skills to collaborate and create an interactive toolkit, inspired in the workshop dynamic, that highlights special qualities, and encourages communities to create safe, inclusive spaces that uplift neurodiverse voices in communities and events.

### Session Plan

####Before the session

Review the session plan and get feedback

Get informed. We have curated a list of articles that can help you understand the subject before you start planning your session:
- The Standford Interest Group for Neurodiversity
- Neurodiversity: What you need to know
- The Myth of the Normal Brain
- Insights from the BRAINHE project

Make sure you have all the materials needed for the session. For our session we used:
- A projector (a laptop could also work)
- A tablet or phone with adobe connect installed (optional)
- Post-its
- Markers, crayons and colored pencils
- A3 paper
- Scissors
- Rulers

Get comfortable with the room you'll be running your session in.
- Have the materials ready before the participants arrive, this will ensure you don't spend your session time doing so.
For our session, we set up small tables with seats for 3-4 participants each and divided our materials to make sure all participants had everything they needed to create their trading cards.
- Make sure the lighting in the room is friendly.
- Make sure the room is accessible for session participants with special needs.
- Make sure we enable ways for others to communicate that don't involve verbal language

#### During the session

Introduce the session goals and ice-breaking activity (10 minutes)
- Introduce yourself (points if you transmit excitement while doing so, participants appreciate knowing they're talking to someone who cares about the subject.
- Know your audience. Try to be as inclusive as possible, make sure you have pen and paper for those not comfortable with verbal communication.
- Invite each participant to say (quickly, in one sentence) their name, pronouns and one thing that makes them different. Well have pen and paper for those not comfortable with verbal language
- Briefly explain the dynamic of the session. Including the objectives.

Discussion: Share your qualities (10 minutes) (optional)
- If participants are comfortable, we encourage you to invite them to break into small groups and share how their differences make them special, give more details about their accomplishment, and ways in which society and their organizations have helped the, highlight their neurodivergent qualities

###  Some questions to help you guide the session 

- What great things have you created? How have your neurodivergent qualities helped you create them?
- Lets talk about community building, How has being neurodiverse helped you help evolve your work environment, institution, project or community?
- Example of inclusive communities that let the neurodiverse raise their voice
- Create, collaborate and share
- Example of communities that exclude the needs of the neurodivergent
- What can the neurotypical do to help the neurodivergent reach their full potential?

#### Deepening: Make your own trading card (30 minutes)

The core activity of the session is to inspire participants to display their qualities, special gifts, and abilities by making their own trading cards, inspired in trading card games popular during the 90s. We created our own personalized trading card templates for the session, you can show them as examples, or create your own!

Give a brief introduction to the trading card templates and invite participants to make their own. Encourage them to be creative and make changes to the templates as much as they want.

Make sure to have enough materials to allow participants to be creative. The materials suggested are listed above.
Encourage participants to write recommendations to communities and spaces to help them show their special abilities . Invite them to answer two questions:
- How might we empower others and help them share their qualities?
= Whatâ€™s the role of institutions, conferences, and spaces during in uplifting neurodivergent voices?

Once participants are done, they will be able to share their learnings in a collective document that will serve as a prototype for a toolkit to assist communities to be more diverse, and take into account the needs of neurodivergent individuals.

#### Synthesis (5 minutes)

- Summarise the session, review what participants achieved, and identify any next steps.
- Share the session notes and resources
- Make sure participants have a way to reach out to you in the future.
